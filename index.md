Are you a busy boss who can't stand hearing your employees go on about personal development? Isn't it enough that you let them work here?

We know you have other things to focus on, like golf, and sucking up to *your* boss, so we've made this Performance Review Randomizer just for you. Spent too much time 'relationship building' with clients to actually turn up at the office? Doesn't matter. Don't know what your team got up to in the last 3 months? Irrelevant. Their goals for the next 3 months? Who cares.

As a busy boss I want to be able to generate a believable performance review without inputting any information about the person. This will allow me to run one for each report very quickly.
