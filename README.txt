Are you a busy boss who can't stand hearing your employees go on about personal development? Isn't it enough that you let them work here?

We know you have other things to focus on, like golf, and sucking up to *your* boss, so we've made this Performance Review Randomizer just for you. Spent too much time 'relationship building' with clients to actually turn up at the office? Doesn't matter. Don't know what your team got up to in the last 3 months? Irrelevant. Their goals for the next 3 months? Who cares.

As a busy boss I want to be able to generate a believable performance review without inputting any information about the person. This will allow me to run one for each report very quickly.

As a busy boss, I rely on my favorite employees to cover my ass, I need to make sure they get good performance reviews and metion them by name, so that they'll continue to make me look good.

As a busy boss, I need to be able to give some of my more annoying reports bad reviews. This will help me generate a hostile work environment towards anyone in my team who questions me, and drive them out.

As a busy boss I need the review generator to reference non-specific work and projects from my reports, so that they think I'm paying attention to their effort.

OPTIONAL: As a busy boss I haven't got time to review comp and benefits. I need the randomizer to assign a % pay increase that seems reasonable based on the feedback. This will save me the hassle of working it out and sending it to finance.


INSTRUCTIONS:
A performance review is generated with the `fullReview()` function, which takes two optional parameters:
- name, leave blank for a random, yet endearing, nickname
- rating, takes either 'good' or 'bad' as a string and will output either a good or a bad review. Leave blank for a random review
- leaving both blank will generate a good or bad review to a non-specific person

NB: if you can't remember the name, but you want to give them a good or bad review, pass '???' as the name argument, followed by the rating parameter.
